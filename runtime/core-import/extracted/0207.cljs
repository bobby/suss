(defn reduce-kv
  "Reduces an associative collection. f should be a function of 3
  arguments. Returns the result of applying f to init, the first key
  and the first value in coll, then applying f to that result and the
  2nd key and value, etc. If coll contains no entries, returns init
  and f is not called. Note that reduce-kv is supported on vectors,
  where the keys will be the ordinals."
