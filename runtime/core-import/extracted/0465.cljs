(defn tree-seq
  "Returns a lazy sequence of the nodes in a tree, via a depth-first walk.
  branch? must be a fn of one arg that returns true if passed a node
  that can have children (but may not).  children must be a fn of one
  arg that returns a sequence of the children. Will only be called on
  nodes for which branch? returns true. Root is the root node of the
